# Regex Tutorial: Demystifying Regular Expressions

Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! In this guide, we will dive into the world of Regular Expressions (Regex) and explore their power in defining search patterns. As a web development student, understanding Regex will enhance your ability to manipulate and process text effectively, a crucial skill in the realm of web development.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will dissect a specific regex that validates email addresses. Regular expressions might appear daunting at first, but they provide a structured way to match and validate complex patterns. Here's the regex we will be exploring:

## Regex Components

### Anchors
- Anchors are symbols that help us assert the position of a match in the input string. The ```^``` symbol in our regex indicates the start of the line, and the ```$``` symbol indicates the end of the line. These anchors ensure that the entire string matches the defined pattern.

### Quantifiers
- Quantifiers determine how many times a character or group should appear in the input for a match to occur. In our regex, the ```+``` quantifier specifies that the preceding character class should appear one or more times.

### Grouping Constructs
- Grouping in regex is denoted by parentheses ```()```. They allow us to treat multiple characters as a single unit and apply quantifiers to that unit. We use grouping in our regex to capture both the username and the domain separately.

### Bracket Expressions
- Bracket expressions, denoted by ```[]```, define a character set from which a single character can match. In our regex, ```[\w\.-]``` matches word characters, dots, and hyphens, allowing us to capture valid username and domain characters.

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes
